# Hand Gesture System

## Description
This is a simple application which is written in C++ using openCV. I had this for my final year college project as a Proof Of Concept. I am putting it on GitHub so that someone much (much^3) better than me will improve the code, make it better.

##Installation

I used Visual Studio C++ to make this along with OpenCV and Boost threading libraries. I pushing the entire project here.

#### Good luck!!
